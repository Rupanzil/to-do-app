# to-do-app
A simple, but functional to-do app.


## Challenges faced during making this app
* JS part was pretty simple. Straight forward logic. Used prepend for the first time to put the newly added tasks in the top
* CSS was challenging, as I am used to use bootstrap, but I decided to used vanilla CSS for this one. It was a good refresher.
* Using vanilla CSS, it becomes challenging to make an app at least decent looking as I am not a designer
* The biggest learning and the challenge was using browser localStorage. This was my first time using browser local storage.
