# to-do-app
A simple, but functional to-do app.

## Objectives
* Main goal was to practice JS and DOM manipulation skills.
* Practice a little bit vanilla CSS.
* Before jumping onto React I want to be absolutely sure with my JS skills
* Using browser's localStorage to persist the data.
* Making it interactive


## Challenges faced during making this app
* JS part was pretty simple. Straight forward logic. Used prepend for the first time to put the newly added tasks in the top
* CSS was challenging, as I am used to use bootstrap, but I decided to used vanilla CSS for this one. It was a good refresher.
* Using vanilla CSS, it becomes challenging to make an app at least decent looking as I am not a designer
* The biggest learning and the challenge was using browser localStorage. This was my first time using browser local storage.


## Planned upgrades for the future
* Making the to-do items draggable, so that the list can be rearranged.
* adding a footer where there will be links to my socials.
* adding a dragging handle.
* adding a delete button in the end of the list items.
* adding a date wise tracker
* Making it a to-do tracker where the completed vs uncompleted tasks will be tracked.
